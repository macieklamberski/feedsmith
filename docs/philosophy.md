# Philosophy

Why should you use this library over the alternatives?

The key advantage of Feedsmith is that it preserves the original feed structure exactly as defined in each specific feed format.

Many alternative packages attempt to normalize data by:

* Merging distinct fields like `author`, `dc:creator`, and `creator` into a single property.
* Combining date fields such as `dc:date` and `pubDate` without preserving their sources.
* Handling multiple `<atom:link>` elements inconsistently, sometimes keeping only the first or last one or ignoring different `rel` attributes.
* Some libraries try to combine different feed formats into one universal structure.

While this approach can be useful for quick reading of feed data, it often results in a loss of information that may be crucial for certain applications, such as reading data from specific namespaces.
