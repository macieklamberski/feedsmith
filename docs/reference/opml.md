# OPML Reference

OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) is a format for exchanging outline-structured information, commonly used for sharing feed subscription lists.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Versions</th>
      <td>1.0, 2.0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Type Definition

> [!INFO]
> `TDate` represents date fields in the type definitions. When **parsing**, dates are returned as strings in their original format (see [Parsing â€º Handling Dates](/parsing/dates) for more details). When **generating**, dates should be provided as JavaScript `Date` objects.
